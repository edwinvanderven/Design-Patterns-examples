# Chain of Responsibility

Official description of the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern

> Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.\
> Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

An example of this design pattern could be the handling of mouse / keyboard events.
