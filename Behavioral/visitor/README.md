# Visitor

Official description of the **Visitor** pattern
> Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.\
> Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

---

This pattern is used when you want to add capabilities to a composite of objects and encapsulation is not important.
