# Observer

Official description of the **Observer** pattern

> Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results with all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.

---

**Observer** allows an object to notify other interested objects.\
It provides a way to subscribe and unsubsribe to and from these notifcations for any object that implements the corresponding interface.
