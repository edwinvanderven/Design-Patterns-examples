# Composite

Official description of the **Composite** pattern

> Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.\
> Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

---

This pattern enables you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.\
A composite contains components, components come in two flavors: composites and leafs.

-   I.e. A menu with sub-menus. This is a tree of objects that is made of parts but that can be treated as a whole.
