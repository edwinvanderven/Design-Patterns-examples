# Decorator

Official description of the **Decorator** pattern
> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface.\
> Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Decorator** allows adding new behavior to objects dynamically by placing them inside a special wrapper object.\
You can wrap objects numerous times since both source and target objects follow the same interface.\
The resulting object will get a stacking behavior of all its wrappers.
