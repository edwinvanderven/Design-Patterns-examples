# Design Patterns examples

Various implementations of different design patterns.

## Introduction

This repository is my attempt to make sense of different design patterns, including tangible examples.\
Every design pattern and code examples will be located into its own subfolder.

### Code Examples

:information_source: Make sure to have [Node and NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

Inside a terminal run the following commands

```sh
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g ts-node
```

Inside a terminal, navigate to the folder with the code example and run the following command

```sh
ts-node index.ts
```
